								<p>
Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) allows decision-makers to achieve target reliability in product
performance under engineering uncertainties. However, existing RBDO studies assume the target reliability as a
given parameter and do not explain how to determine the optimal target reliability. From the perspective of the
market, designing a product with high target reliability can satisfy many customers and increase market demand,
but it can generate a large cost leading to profit reduction of the company. Therefore, the target reliability should
be a decision variable which needs to be found to maximize the company profit. This paper proposes a reliabilitybased design for market systems (RBDMS) framework by integrating RBDO and design for market systems (DMS)
approaches to find the optimal target reliability. The proposed RBDMS framework is applied to electric vehicle
(EV) design problems to validate effect of the target reliability on company profit – or market share – and
engineering performances of EV. Several observations about the optimal target reliability are presented from the
case study with various scenarios. From the EV design case study, it is verified that the proposed RBDMS
framework is an effective way of finding the optimal target reliability that maximizes the company profit, and the
optimal target reliability varies depending on the situation of market and competitors.

								<p>
								Manufacturers must decide when to invest and launch a new
vehicle segment or how to redesign vehicles existing segment,
both under market uncertainties. We present an optimization
framework for redesigning or investing in future
vehicles using real options to address uncertainty in gas price
and regulatory standards like the US Corporate Average Fuel
Economy (CAFE) standard. In a specific study involving a
product of gasoline, hybrid electric, and electric vehicles, we
examine the relationship between gas price and CAFE uncertainties
to support decisions by manufacturers on product
mix and by policy makers on proposing standards. A real
options model is used for the time delay on investment, redesign,
and pricing, integrated with a robust design formulation
to optimize expected net present value (ENPV) and
net present value (NPV) robustness. Results for nine different
scenarios suggest that policy makers should consider
gas price when setting CAFE standards; and manufacturers
should consider the trade-off between ENPV and robust
NPVs. Results also suggest that change of product mix rather
than vehicle redesign better addresses CAFE standards inflation.

								<h5 class="font-alt m-t-0">Reliability-based Design Optimization (RBDO) for Electric Vehicle Market Systems</h5>
								<p>When designing a product, both engineering uncertainty and market
heterogeneity should be considered to reduce the risk of failure in the
market. Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) approach allows
decision makers to achieve target confidence in product performance under
engineering uncertainty. Design for market systems (DMS) approach
helps decision makers to find profit-maximized product design under
market heterogeneity. This paper integrates RBDO and DMS approaches
for an Electric vehicle (EV) design. Consumers’ preferences on warranted
battery lifetime are heterogeneous while battery life itself is affected
by various uncertainties such as battery characteristics and driving
patterns. We optimized and compared four scenarios depending on
whether engineering systems are deterministic or probabilistic, and
whether a market is homogeneous or heterogeneous. The results provide
some insight on how the optimal EV design should be altered depending
on engineering uncertainty and market heterogeneity.</p>

								<p>
								Governments encourage use of electric vehicles (EV) via regulation and investment to
minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Manufacturers produce vehicles to maximize
profit, given available public infrastructure and government incentives. EV public adoption
depends not only on price and vehicle attributes, but also on EV market size and
infrastructure available for refueling, such as charging station proximity and recharging
length and cost. Earlier studies have shown that government investment can create EV
market growth, and that manufacturers and charging station operators must cooperate
to achieve overall profitability. This article describes a framework that connects decisions
by the three stakeholders (government, EV manufacturer, charging station operator) with
preferences of the driving public. The goal is to develop a framework that allows the
effect of government investment on the EV market to be quantified. This is illustrated
in three scenarios in which we compare optimal public investment for a city in USA
(Ann Arbor, Michigan) and one in China (Beijing) to minimize emissions, accounting
for customer preferences elicited from surveys conducted in the two countries. Under the
modeling assumptions of the framework, we find that high customer sensitivity to prices,
combined with manufacturer and charging station operator profit maximization strategies,
can render government investment in EV subsidies ineffective, while a collaboration
among stakeholders can achieve both emission reduction and profitability. When EV and
station designs improve beyond a certain threshold, government investment influence on
EV adoption is attenuated apparently due to diminishing customer willingness to buy.
Furthermore, our analysis suggests that a diversified government investment portfolio
could be especially effective for the Chinese market, with charging costs and price cuts
on license plate fees being as important as EV subsidies.

								<h5 class="font-alt m-t-0">Integrated Decision Making in Electric Vehicle and Charging Station Location Network Design</h5>
								<p>
								A major barrier in consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is “range anxiety,” the
concern that the vehicle will run out of power at an inopportune time. Range anxiety is
caused by the current relatively low electric-only operational range and sparse public
charging station (CS) infrastructure. Range anxiety may be significantly mitigated if EV
manufacturers and CS operators work in partnership using a cooperative business model
to balance EV performance and CS coverage. This model is in contrast to a sequential
decision-making model where manufacturers bring new EVs to the market first and CS
operators decide on CS deployment given EV specifications and market demand. This
paper proposes an integrated decision-making framework to assess profitability of a
cooperative business model using a multidisciplinary optimization model that combines
marketing, engineering, and operations considerations. This model is demonstrated in a
case study involving battery EV design and direct current (DC) fast-CS location network
in Southeast Michigan. The expected benefits can motive both government and private
enterprise actions.
